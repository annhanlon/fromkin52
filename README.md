# Mapping Race and Resistance: The 52nd Annual Morris Fromkin Memorial Lecture

This year's Morris Fromkin Memorial Lecture focuses on the racial geography of Milwaukee - and the role of racial housing covenants have played in defining ongoing racial boundaries in our city. But it is also a story of resistance. According to speakers Anne Bonds and Derek Handley, "Our focus on efforts to challenge covenants explores the lived experiences of covenants and ways in which Black organizations and residents of Milwaukee County envisioned and articulated their claims for racial and spatial justice."

## Redlining

This 1938 map of Milwaukee was created by Home Owners' Loan Corporation - a federal agency created as part of the New Deal to help stabilize the home mortgage market. But it also introduced the concept of redlining. Neighborhoods were designated by different grades meant to signify risk investment. These grades effectively outlined the racial contours of the city and systematially embedded economic disadvantages by making it difficult to impossible to secure home loans in areas deemed "third" or "fourth" grade.

## Racial covenants

The work has been in the collection of the Mauritshuis in The Hague since 1902 and has been the subject of various 
literary treatments. In 2006, the Dutch public selected it as the most beautiful painting in the Netherlands.
